Hello. My name is Nataliia. I am from Ukraine, but now I live in Poland. I am a junior front-end developer. And now about who I am and how I got into programming.
I graduated the National University of Railway Transport with a master's degree in "Management of the transportation process", and the International University of Finance with a specialist degree in Finance. Before I decided to change my profession to a front-end developer, I worked as an engineer for the organization and regulation of labor in a railway company. I have been in this position for the past 15 years.
I became interested in programming because I like my brain to work, I like challenging tasks, I like to solve complex problems, and I like to learn and develop. Now I'm on the course of front-end development in RSSchool. I came to this course to gain the knowledge and skills necessary for the work of a developer. I like the course. All tasks are very interesting. This is an online zoo project, where was both an adaptive layout and functionality in javascript, this is a online bookshop on pure javascript, and an application for racing with the definition of winners.
The most difficult for me was the Async-Race project where I worked with API using asynchronous javascript functions. But thanks to the good presentation of the educational material, I managed to understand the work of the program and complete the task.

Also, before studying at RSScool, I had done the following works: application "Weather Forecast" on Javascript and application "Weather" on React; multi-page site for Webstudio, and my portfolio, created in two different versions.
At the moment I have skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. On this slide you can see the whole list of my skills.
I have a family: husband and two sons. We spend all our free time together. We like outdoor and table games.

My goal is to do what I like. I love coding and fishing. My strengths lie in learning quickly and striving to learn. If you want find more details about me please refer below this video where the link on my CV is attached.
There is also a link to my portfolio under this video where all my works is shown. My works has an open-source on GitHub, link you find in my CV or portfolio. If you would like to contact me, you can see my contacts here.

Thank you for watching. And have a nice day!
